Python:

It is a simple, general purpose, high level and object oriented programing language.

Python is an interpreted scripting language also. Guido Van Rossum is known as fouder of python language.

It is simple and easy to learn and provides a lot of high level data structure.

Python's syntax and dynamic typing with it interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.

Python support multiple programing pattern like, object oriented, impretive and functional and procedural typing style.

Python is not intended to work in a particular area such as web programing. It is multipurpose programing language used in web, enterprise, 3d cat, AI ML, data science.

We don't need to use data type to declare variable because it is dynamically typed.
So, we can write:
a = 10

Curly brackets {} not used in python.

Python make the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included and edit text debug cycle is very fast.

File extension -->  .py

Q1.  Where is python used?
Ans. Data science, Data mining, desktop application, console based application, mobile application, software development, AI ML, web application, enterprise application, 3d cat application, computer vision and image processing, speech recognisation.


Framework / libraries:
--> Web development (server side): django, pyramid, cherrypie, flask.
--> GUI based application: Tk, PyGTK, PyQt, Pyjs.
--> ML: TensorFlow, PyTouch, scikit-learn, Matplotib, SciPy, etc...
--> Maths: numpy, pandas.

a = 10          |   x = 4.5
b = 40          |   y = 6.0
c = a + b       |   print(x+y)
print(c)        |
print("sum x =",c)
